# WaniCTF 2024 Writeup

[WaniCTF 2024](https://wanictf.org/) was a 48 hour competition that ran from 6/21/2024 to 6/23/2024. Below are my writeups for the challenges that I was able to complete. You can also see my results
in the competition and the software I used below my writeups.

## Solved Challenges



## Software and Tools

The challenges I completed during this competition did not require many special tools. I was able to solve all of the challenges I attempted using my laptop with [Ubuntu 22.04](https://ubuntu.com/desktop), as well as [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) through [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
