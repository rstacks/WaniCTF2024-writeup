## Solution

- The provided script in the zip file above is made up of dozens of nested lambda functions. I asked [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to rewrite this script with
named functions to make it readable. [This](https://github.com/rstacks/WaniCTF2024-writeup/blob/master/Reversing/lambda/gpt_rewrite.py) is what ChatGPT came up with.
- I wrote my own [script](https://github.com/rstacks/WaniCTF2024-writeup/blob/master/Reversing/lambda/undoing_lambda.py) to reverse the steps shown in the program
generated by ChatGPT. I lifted the functions from the ChatGPT output and ran them in reverse order of how they appeared. This yielded the flag.
